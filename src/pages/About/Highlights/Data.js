In the field and in the lab, we use the geological record of life to guide questions about major transformations across Vertebrata, especially at the origins of birds and mammals. To address the nature and mechanism of pivotal events at crucial points in evolutionary history, we bring to bear a full range of modern biological and geological techniques, especially molecular developmental biology and functional biology, coupled with advanced three-dimensional imaging and geometric analysis. However we maintain a surpassing commitment to the discovery of new fossils in the field; these will always be the inspiration, the grist, and the final validating test for work on the history of life.",

            long: "Professor Derek Briggsâ€™ primary research interest is in the preservation and evolutionary significance of exceptionally preserved fossils. This involves a range of approaches from experimental work on the factors controlling decay and fossilization, through studies of early mineralization and organic preservation, to field work on a range of extraordinary fossil occurrences and their description and analysis. Prof. Briggs has worked on exceptionally preserved specimens in the Burgess Shale of Canada, an area of exceptionally preserved fossils.",
