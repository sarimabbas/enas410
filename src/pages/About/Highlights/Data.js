Participants then engaged in various arts and crafts projects with natural history themes and a paper airplane contest judged on accuracy, time aloft and distance traveled. There was also a trip to the Leitner Family Observatory in Farnham Memorial Gardens for star gazing and a mystery fossil hunt, in which children searched throughout the building for fossils and kept those they found.<br/>The event’s different stations were manned by volunteers, including Peabody employees and Yale students.<br/>“I think it really gives families time to do things together without having to worry about the usual stuff like who’s doing the dishes after dinner or anything else like that,” Lourdes Rojas, a Dino-Snore volunteer and museum assistant, said.<br/>Another volunteer, Papia Ghosh GRD ’06, said the fun in volunteering stemmed from the children’s excitement.<br/>“I just really enjoy all the energy the kids have,” Ghosh said. “It’s really cute. At my station, they were making dinosaur puppets and then talking in little voices. It’s good for them—they learn and have fun.”<br/>The event costs a total of $40 per participant, including parents, who call as early as Oct. 4 to ensure they are not put on the waiting list, which has been large in past years.<br/>Julia Pazareskis of Wallingford, who was present with her husband and two children, said spaces for the event sell out quickly.<br/>“We chose to be members of the Peabody just so we could come to the Dino-Snore again, and we called right at 9 a.m. to make sure we got in,” Pazareskis said. “We did it in the spring and we loved it—the fossil hunt, the crafts. I mean, my kids love dinosaurs, so this is the perfect thing for us.”<br/>Her son, Jared, said he enjoyed the paper airplanes and cutting dinosaurs out of construction paper at Rojas’ arts and crafts station.<br/>“I like the paper airplanes the best because my dad helped me, and we cut little things on the wings, and that helped it stay up longer,” the six-year-old said.<br/>Overall, the sleepovers are usually a success, Heiser said, and the greatest problem is people not being able to sleep.<br/>“One year we had someone complaining because somebody was [snoring] at the Dino-Snore, so that person didn’t really get to sleep much. But other than things like that, things have never really gone wrong,” Heiser said.<br/>This Dino-Snore’s turnout and the enthusiastic response of the children, parents and volunteers show the event achieved its educational and family-focused goals, he said.<br/>“What we are aiming for here is fun through education and quality family time,” Heiser said.",

The event included a “tour of terror,” the chance to touch live snakes, a costume contest, a live DJ and food. Attended by over 500 guests, the occasion marks one of the first ever 18-and-over only events at the Peabody.<br/>“I’m very excited for an event that gets adults in the museum having fun and getting more accustomed with the collections,” Peabody Head of Education and Public Outreach David Heiser said. He added that the event is the perfect opportunity for undergraduates to mingle with the greater New Haven community.<br/>In past years, the Peabody hosted public Halloween events geared toward families. Event themes included “the natural history of witches and wizards” and “creepy crawlies.” But last year, the museum staff felt they were overloaded with public events and did not host a Halloween happening, Heiser said. However, this year, the staff, missing the Halloween preparations, decided to create a scary event specifically for adults.<br/>For the costume contest, prizes were awarded in two categories—individual and group costumes. Peabody Director David Skelly, Business Manager Susan Castaldi and Director of Public Programs Richard Kissel functioned as the evening’s judges. Prior to the competition, Kissel said he looked forward to the creativity and diversity of costumes among attendees. Winners received gift certificates to Modern Apizza and BAR.<br/>The haunted crawl included museum staff dressed as mummies, disfigured corpses and mad scientists, all doing their best to spook attendees.<br/>“I was actually scared during the haunted house,” Juliet Ryan ’16 said. “But I was in love with the ’70s music vibe.”<br/>Ryan, dressed as Blues Clues, also had the chance to touch live reptiles and hold her first “legless lizard,” brought by a local reptile keeper to the Peabody. The keeper also brought anacondas, corn snakes and a Burmese python that weighed in at 85 pounds and measured over 13 feet long. Ryan said she “cried a little” when she touched it.<br/>The walk also included a “mad scientist room” which featured parts of the Peabody collection not usually on display. Castaldi said the staff took this room as an educational opportunity to allow visitors to view more specimens—but in a very lighthearted way.<br/>“We have a wonderful assortment of creepy and crawly from the collections, including exotic looking worms, squids, octopi and some wonderfully grotesque creatures in jars,” Kissel said. “We want to set the mood of Halloween.”<br/>Kissel also handed out special treats, including chocolate-covered ants and crickets, for those visitors who were brave enough to walk—or run—through the haunted crawl.<br/>Susan Castaldi said that between Monday and Wednesday afternoon, over 300 tickets were sold. The event sold out at 520 tickets, 67 percent of which were purchased by Yale graduate and undergraduate students, 21 percent by faculty and staff and 12 percent by the general public.<br/>Standing outside the packed museum, Andres Valdivieso ’16 waited as his friend experienced the haunted crawl without him. Valdivieso said he had told all of his friends to buy tickets for the event, but he forgot to buy his own and was surprised that the event sold out.<br/>Castaldi said the museum plans to continue this event in the future. Staff even hope to have two similar adult-only events in the spring, she added.",

His gift—one of the largest in Yale’s history and the single largest donation to a U.S. natural history museum to date —will allow the museum to expand its classroom, exhibition, research and collection storage spaces.",
            long: "The Peabody has now sought input from Yale students and various faculty members to determine the best ways to improve the museum with the historic donation.<br/>“What we are trying to do with the renovation is place these collections—these objects, the specimens—and the expertise that is represented by the museum’s staff, the curators, in the hands of Yale faculty and students from all across the university,” director of the Peabody David Skelly said.<br/>Only 0.0004 percent of the museum’s expansive 13-million-piece collection is currently shown to the public, according to Skelly. But additional exhibition space, to be built as part of the new renovation, will allow for more of the collection to go on display. The expanded galleries will also feature student-curated exhibitions.<br/>The Peabody is also interested in revamping how visitors interact with its exhibits. Undergraduate students taking the project-based course “Making Spaces” have already begun generating potential ideas for new ways that visitors can experience the renovated galleries.<br/>“The students are working very closely with Peabody affiliates and representatives to think about that reimagined Peabody—what is the future of the natural history museum?” said Joseph Zinter, a lecturer within the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences who teaches the seminar.<br/>And though Zinter’s students are still ironing out their designs, Skelly said that they have already had fantastic insights. In past iterations of the course, students created interactive devices that could give visitors personalized tours of the Smithsonian Arts and Industries Building.<br/>The Peabody’s public galleries will close in 2020 for the renovation. Many of the museum’s daily activities, like research and supporting undergraduate education, will continue while the galleries are under construction.<br/>Community engagement and established programs hosted by the Peabody, like their after-school enrichment program, will also still be offered by the museum. The Peabody also plans to open the disassembly of its towering Brontosaurus skeleton—the first one ever discovered—to the public.<br/>Bass’ donation will also allow the museum to add five classrooms designed for faculty use throughout the gallery. Lacking significant classroom space in the current building, professors have had difficulties reliably incorporating the Peabody’s collections into their lesson plans. These new classrooms will be modeled in a way similar to those found in the Beinecke Library or Yale University Art Gallery.<br/>“The museum has not been a place where every single Yale College student comes, and it needs to be,” Skelly said.<br/>This semester, Skelly is teaching a first-year seminar called “Collections of the Peabody Museum,” which, he said, exemplifies the Peabody’s vision to engage more students in research using the museum’s collections following the renovations.<br/>“When people think about museums, especially natural history museums, they don’t realize that the main purpose of these places is research—people just think it’s for entertainment or just for education—but it’s a dedicated space to house these millions of items and all these departments for the sole purpose of people coming and studying and researching them,” said Danielle de Haerne ’22, one of Skelly’s students.<br/>For her research project in the class, Naomi Shimberg ’22 is using the Peabody collections to study herbivory, or plant-eating. She said that the class was able to choose from a slew of academic subjects for their projects, ranging from paleontology to the history of the Peabody itself.<br/>The Peabody was founded over 150 years ago when Yale sought to bolster its profile in the sciences during a rush of archaeological discoveries in the late 1800s.<br/>“Back in the 19th century, a museum was kind of like today’s tech startups, it was a way you really innovated in the sciences,” Skelly explained.<br/>Fields like molecular biology and physics, which require their own dedicated facilities, expanded during the 20th century. During this time, research within museums fell out of the public’s curiosity, but that trend has since reversed.<br/>“In recent decades, what we have discovered is that what we can understand from objects—from materials, from specimens—has just exploded,” he said. “So the collections in the museum have become this irreplaceable resource that can be put toward uses that the folks who collected these objects may never have possibly imagined.”<br/>More than 150,000 people visit the Peabody each year.",

These creatures thrived in shallow ocean waters over 400 million years ago, according to Derek Briggs, curator-in-charge of invertebrate paleontology at Yale’s Peabody Museum of Natural History. Briggs said that these sea scorpions had prominent eyes and clawlike limbs, which were found under their large head shields. These sea scorpions could have grown over nine feet in length, according to a 2014 study Briggs and his colleagues published in the journal Biology Letters.<br/>After Ciurca’s find, he set out to learn more about eurypterids—a quest that has led the Rochester, New York, resident across the state and even into Canada in search of more rocks containing these fossils.<br/>Ciurca’s fossil-hunting excursions have garnered thousands of different specimens. The amateur collector has assembled the largest and most diverse collection of eurypterid fossils in the world, and he has donated nearly 15,000 specimens—amounting to over 60,000 total pounds of rock—ƒto the Peabody, according to the museum’s website. Ciurca’s generous donations to his namesake “Ciurca Collection” at the Peabody have significantly bolstered the museum’s eurypterid collection.<br/>Decades ago, as Ciurca developed an interest in the ancient remains of these sea scorpions, he realized that the creatures had largely been overlooked by scientists.<br/>“At the time, there was little interest, even in the literature,” Ciurca said. “Nobody was really into eurypterids.”<br/>Ciurca’s efforts were bolstered by New York’s state paleontologist, a government-appointed scientist who is in charge of curating the New York State Museum’s paleontology collection. Ciurca said that the state paleontologist tipped him off to a stretch of rock that may have contained eurypterids. The rock was located in Herkimer, New York—over 150 miles away from Ciurca’s hometown of Rochester.<br/>“I went there and I just got into this hard rock and starting finding [eurypterids],” Ciurca said. “I started going there every weekend after work for weekend after weekend, and started finding a lot of them.”<br/>As he trekked around the state hunting for fossils, Ciurca kept meticulous notes of his findings and even discovered new layers of rock that had never been recorded before, which he said “added to the excitement” of his excursions.<br/>Ciurca also collected other creatures fossilized around the eurypterid remains—including ancient snails, clams and shrimplike specimens—which offered researchers a broader look at the life that existed millions of years ago.<br/>Ciurca’s work caught the eye of some Yale scientists associated with the Peabody, sparking a series of collaborations that started over a decade ago. After his interactions with these researchers, Ciurca eventually decided to donate specimens to the Peabody.<br/>“I decided that they were doing so much research there, that it would be neat to get involved with them,” he said.<br/>Just last summer, Ciurca donated another 5,000 specimens to the Peabody.",

I decided that the mount would look better with longer fur, so I “harvested” fur from the neck and leg on the non-show side, felted it into Remay fabric, and glued them on, one on top of the other on the foreleg.<br/>Now, I will start again recoloring the female and move to the male. I hope to be done with all the recoloring on the mounts by the end of next week. That will leave only the preparation work of the grasses and the fabrication of the Scarlet Globemallow flowers. In addition to the Bison, we got the OK to recolor the Alaskan Brown Bear and the Mule Deer while the enclosure is up. The glass will be removed from these other dioramas on June 20th if all goes as planned.<br/>I have only been able to dream that I could restore these taxidermy mounts, the “stars” of the Peabody dioramas.

The big pieces of glass on front of most of our dioramas are hinged at the top and it is possible for me to open them by myself with just a screwdriver. I remove the screws and swing the glass up onto stanchions to hold it so I can slip into the diorama. It’s a good design except we have had one diorama where the hinges rusted over time and the glass cracked as we tried to pull it open. In the Musk Ox we didn’t have this problem.<br/>The musk ox, like the bison mounts are historic. They were taken off display and decommissioned by the American Museum of Natural History in New York City in the mid 1940’s, which is when the Peabody brought them to New Haven. The musk ox mounts were done by John Rowley, an apprentice of Jenness Richardson, the taxidermist of the Peabody’s bison. Rowley was a full-blown student of diorama construction. In 1898, he wrote about newly innovated sculptural techniques in taxidermy and some early descriptions of how to fabricate lifelike foliage with wax and paper. Rowley had much to do with the development of museum dioramas just as those ideas were starting to coalesce in others like Carl Akeley and James L. Clark.<br/>By repairing both the bison and the musk ox mounts, I have noticed there was a difference between Rowley’s tanning methods vs his teacher’s. The Richardson 1889 bison mounts were cracked on the midline both on top and underneath. There were transverse cracks on the flanks and every leg had large splits in the skin. In contrast, the Rowley musk ox were only cracked underneath and two out of four legs were open on the female and the male. Clearly, Rowley had used a different tanning recipe that, I believe didn’t include sulfuric acid, which continues to degrade the composition of the skin over the years.<br/>Therefore, the repair process on the musk ox wasn’t as extensive as the bison and since the cracks were not visible, I didn’t have to “felt” fur into the cracks as I did with the bison. The biggest problem was keeping the long hair out of my face while working underneath them! Once the repairs were made, I mixed the Orasol dyes to a couple of dark brown blends and recolored all three mounts.<br/>The final task was to replace all of the old “snow” (ground limestone and shredded theatrical plastic) with finely ground up white conservator’s foam called ethafoam. This new innovation came from the conservators at the American Museum of Natural History during the renovation of the North American Mammal Hall. As with other Peabody dioramas, I consulted Julia Sybalski, AMNH conservator. She also told me about a white ceramic batting they used as an under-layer in place of the cotton. Both the ceramic batting and the ethafoam have a much longer life and won’t turn yellow. I removed all the old cotton and “snow”, I put down a layer of ceramic batting on top of the plaster base, and sprinkled the ground ethafoam over that to finish up this diorama. The before and after differences due to the renovation in this diorama are not that dramatic, but it makes me happy to know that the mounts are stable, the darker color of the fur won’t fade, and that the foreground snow should stay white for many years to come.",

I was worried I might have to break into the surface of the foreground to get the grass placed naturally, but I shaved the protruding grass under the mesh to about 1/2″ or less and the plaster blends it nicely into the existing foreground. As a final step, I will glue single blades of grass between the tufts to help blend them together.<br/>The plaster will be painted to blend in with the color of the foreground and extra dirt will be spread over that to make the new grass blend in with the old surface. I will be using the Wyoming grass in the most prominent spots since I don’t have enough to extend back into the less visible area behind the bison.<br/>In areas not easily seen, I have re-installed the old Connecticut grass clumps from when the diorama was first built.

They sometimes burrow into the dirt, but after going through it over and over, he still couldn’t find it. I joked that the big one probably ate him. Just then, Stefan looked into the other side with the larger scorpion and he said that’s exactly what happened. He found a small portion of the distal end of the tail with the stinger right next to the mouth of the larger scorpion. Stefan thinks that the smaller scorpion burrowed down to the plastic partition and nudged it up enough to slip into the other side. Not a good choice Mr. Vaejovis!

Collin and I looked closely at each diorama to note where we might improve them. The mammal taxidermy in many of these dioramas need repair and recoloring, but there will be some need for creation of new leaves, installing new snow, and coloring groundcover and epiphytes.<br/>Additionally, in the Desert diorama, there are dried specimens of scorpions and centipedes that periodically disappear as a result of living populations of carpet beetles inside the dioramas. Therefore, I would like to create 3D models of some of these invertebrate specimens. The sizes of the specimens pose a problem. We are looking into whether our scans are good enough or whether our printers are precise enough to pick up minute detail like legs and antennae. Also, the scanner doesn’t like dark, shiny surfaces (mostly what we have to scan) and the scans tend to go haywire.<br/>To see if it is possible to scan and print small bodies with small appendages, we have to experiment with testing removable surface materials.<br/>We had to get specimens of less importance on which to practice. My colleague, Maishe Dickman is an avid insect collector with a special interest in giant Titan Beetles from the neotropics. The smaller specimens are not as important to Maishe, so he agreed to bring in several of the smaller ones for us to work on. He had them in the freezer, so they had to be thawed, pinned and dried.<br/>Just the drying alone takes several days. In the meantime, Nicole Palffy-Muhoray, representing the Entomology Department, told me that we could use specimens from the Entomology study collection so long as we can wash off the surfacing materials we apply. I asked her how to wash a beetle and she brought over an ultrasonic jewelry cleaner! I was floored that this is how specimens are cleaned in the Entomology collection.<br/>We picked out several beetles, scorpions, and centipedes from the study collection and began to experiment. I wondered how dusting might work. Collin sanded several sticks of chalk to dust and I have whiting that I use in mache, which also turns out to be chalk dust! I have confectioners sugar, which I have used in the past on my silicone castings and Kremer dry white pigment. I went online because I figure others have run into this problem and must have found a solution. The solution I found is to adjust the settings of the scanner and to use an opaque, matte “developer” aerosol called Spotcheck. Spotcheck is very expensive, so we will continue our experiments…<br/>It took about five minutes to realize that dusting won’t work because the surfaces of the bugs are too smooth for the dust to grab on to. Gum Arabic, a water-soluble tree sap, was suggested at an art supply house as a reversible medium in which to add the dusting powders to create a paintable surface. This basically creates watercolor pigment and can be built up over several layers to coat the insects. Nicole went to Michael’s craft store and picked up some reversible children’s poster paints and a spray can of chalk dust as additional materials to experiment with.<br/>We will try scanning these three test subjects to see if the scans work and if the surfacing material can be easily removed. More to come soon.",

Today, he is painting the final touches on the last one, the White-rumped Sandpiper. When painting is completed, we will have our ornithology collections manager, Kristof Zyskowski, critique them, after which we will install them in the Connecticut Bird Hall alongside the previously approved, Baird’s Sandpiper. With four models produced from one digital scan of a taxidermied Baird’s Sandpiper, we had to print the models at varying percentages from the original. With each model that was reduced from the original, I made sure the wing and leg lengths were accurate for the specific bird. Each unique bill was cast in epoxy and attached to the models. All defining field marks were painted and the local color of the feathers was ascertained by matching it to a study skin from the collections. (see the previous blog post, “The First Digital Bird Lands”)<br/><br/>New Horizons:<br/>With the Blended Realities project well on its way, we are looking to other ways to use the SPROUT workstation. Recently, I sculpted a “gestural” model of a Merlin falcon in clay. I didn’t have a taxidermied mount to scan, so I am sculpting a clay model in the position I want for the Bird Hall. I have started with clay sculptures before and typically, I would make a 2 part plaster mold of the clay sculpture and cast a copy in wax. This would usually take eight to ten hours of my time.<br/>In this case, Collin scanned the clay sculpture and it is now being printed out in plastic.<br/>Once the feather detail is carved into the wax, we will paint directly on the wax.  The 3D plastic sculpture covered with a thin layer of wax, painted to look realistic, is robust enough to install directly without having to make another rubber mold and cast. This is another big time and money saver<br/>Another experiment came about when I discovered that the Long-tailed Weasel in the Forest Margin diorama had received a serious case of insect damage. We removed it from the diorama and decided to try scanning and printing it as is. You can easily patch the areas decimated by bugs with wax and there were other areas where the model had to be sanded using the original taxidermy mount as a guide. I know how to sculpt bird feathers, but I don’t have a lot of experience sculpting mammal fur. I’m going to get a lesson with Dorcas MacClintock and see if I can get something good enough to install in the diorama.",

Most were found in farmers’ fields or in early excavations when archaeological methods were imprecise and less sophisticated than today. <br/>The exhibition asks, “Can artistic interpretation and scientific investigation co-exist?” The answer is a resounding “yes” as the goal of archaeologist and artist alike is to “ponder the imponderable, to get into the mind of the long-dead creator,” says Roderick McIntosh, professor of anthropology at Yale.<br/>“Being excited to wonder about the ineffable — daring to imagine that one human being might delve inside the mind of another human being who lived 100 generations ago — might just be the key to being human,” adds McIntosh, who is also curator-in-charge of anthropology at the Yale Peabody Museum.<br/>Kavanagh, a New Haven-born artist, has been in awe of these figures since seeing the so-called “Venus of Lespugue” in Paris as a child. She began contemplating “how people living at the edges of glacial ice could produce such expressive sculpture with stone tools,” she says. She was also intrigued by how the figures evoke the sculpture of Modernists like Hans Arp, Joan Miró, and Henry Moore, who have long informed her work.<br/>For the exhibition Kavanagh faithfully replicated 12 of the ancient figures, choosing polymer and bronze as her medium in lieu of the soft stone, bone, and ivory from which many of the originals were carved, or the clay from which some were formed and fired. Whereas the original figures ranged from 1.4 to 8.9 inches high, Kavanagh enlarged the scale of hers to make the surface details more visible.<br/>She then placed them in seashells selected to complement each figure. Shells have not only informed Kavanagh’s own work but have long been associated with birth and regeneration. Each of the figures shown in its shell is a complete sculpture and can be compared with its original artifact.<br/><br/>The 12 artifacts providing inspiration for Kavanagh’s sculptures include:<br/>1. Hohle Fels. Excavated in 2008 from the Hohle Fels Caves of Schelkingen, Germany, and claimed by some to date as early as 40,000 BCE, this piece can only be roughly attributed to sometime before the early Solutrean (before c.24,000).<br/>2. Brassempouy. This head in mammoth ivory is purportedly from the Grotte du Pape in southwestern France. It is considered one of the finest pieces of the earliest Aurignacial (after 30,000 BCE). Her tiny triangular face bears an intense stare and pronounced brow but no mouth.<br/>3. Lespugue. This Gravettian (c. 25,000 BCE) piece from the Les Rideaux Cave in the Pyrenees is the figure that inspired Kavanagh as a child. Possessing the most pronounced features of all Upper Paleolithic figures, her enormous breasts, buttocks, belly and thighs are fashioned into a nest of eggs. Picasso purportedly kept two castings of her in his studio, considering her the “quintessential female form.<br/>4. Willendorf. Because of her enormous breasts, enlarged abdomen and ample buttocks, she is one of the most recognizable of Upper Paleolithic pieces. Willendorf lacks a secure date but the piece may possibly be late Gravettian (post-25,000 BCE).<br/>Kavanagh is a daughter of George Kubler, who is considered one of the most influential art historians of the 20th century. Nurtured in an environment rich in the visual arts, her artistic consciousness was further developed by extensive travels and study in South America and Europe. She taught herself to carve stone in the Modernist tradition of Moore, Barbara Hepworth and Arp, eventually developing a signature style of her own characterized by rounded, sensual shapes. As demand for her sculpture increased, Kavanagh began carving maquettes out of polystyrene, finishing them with plaster for casting in bronze and aluminum. She has exhibited at the American Museum of Natural History, the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History, and the Peabody-Essex Museum.<br/>“The Artist’s Eye: Figurines of the Paleolithic” is open during regular museum hours: Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sundays from noon to 5 p.m.",

            long: "The venerable <i>Brontosaurus excelsus</i>, that gargantuan, long-necked sauropod that roamed the earth 150 million years ago, has reclaimed a distinct spot in the fossil record. New research by Emanuel Tschopp of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa in Portugal recently concluded that Brontosaurus was, in fact, a distinct species from Apatosaurus based on unique physical characteristics.<br/>Scientists had stripped Brontosaurus of its separate status in the early 1900s, saying that Brontosaurus fossils were, in fact, specimens of the previously named Apatosaurus. This was of particular importance at Yale, where pioneering paleontologist O.C. Marsh had given the Brontosaurus its name in 1879, and where the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History had the most complete Brontosaurus skeleton — discovered in Wyoming — on display in the Great Hall of Dinosaurs.<br/>On April 14, the museum will officially re-label its specimen Brontosaurus.<br/>YaleNews spoke with Jacques Gauthier, professor of geology and geophysics and curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Peabody, to talk about all things Brontosaurus.<br/><b>Were you surprised by the reclassification?</b><br/>I knew this was coming. More than one set of researchers was beginning to look into it, and then Emanuel locked in. His approach was to say: I’m going to look at each specimen independently, take down the data from each one of them, run it through phylogenetic software packages, and create a family tree that will tell me, ‘this specimen goes here and that specimen goes there.’ That way, you discover the species, rather than frontload them into your analysis.<br/><b>Do you agree with this approach?</b><br/>Yes, I believe it’s the most modern method for doing the sort of analysis we’re talking about here. You’re not deciding on the boundaries of each species in advance. I’ve had students who have used this method with turtles, for example. This is a modern approach to paleontology.<br/><b>Did the researchers looking at Brontosaurus visit Yale?</b><br/>Yes, they were here last year to look at and measure our specimens. We were delighted.<br/><b>So you’re happy about the name change.</b><br/>I am, and I don’t know why, exactly. But I really am. I like the idea that we’re finding out more about the structure of nature because of this. I also thought it was good that this result came from someone who doesn’t have a dog in the fight, like I do. I’ve always liked the name Brontosaurus, which means “thunder lizard.”<br/><b>What does the name change mean for the museum, in practical terms?</b><br/>We have a lot of labels in the museum that make mention of Apatosaurus. Now we need to go change them, which is a painful thing. Also, we’re racing around now to see if we can find an Apatosaurus neck rib that we can show, to compare it with the neck ribs of Brontosaurus. It’s easy to see the difference between them. Tschopp’s study discovered at least seven different anatomical characteristics separating Brontosaurus from Apatosaurus.<br/><b>What does this new information say about Brontosaurus beyond particular physical differences from Apatosaurus?</b><br/>It says that Brontosaurus was not merely a variation. It says Brontosaurus was on its own, independent evolutionary path. It also means there were more kinds of giant sauropods lumbering about than we once thought.<br/><b>Does it also create educational and research opportunities for Yale?</b><br/>I hope it will be a springboard for renewed interest, both here on campus and in the international scientific community, for what we have in the Great Hall.

            long: "“Start Here” instructs a blue Post-It note stuck on a rack of wooden specimen drawers in the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History’s entomology collection.  Each drawer contains rows of butterfly specimens of various sizes and colors carefully pinned under glass.<br/>A student worker will pick up that first drawer, move the Post-It to the next one, and remove the butterflies. The data on the labels attached to the pins, along with digital images of certain specimens, will be entered into the Peabody’s collections management database, where researchers worldwide can access them with a few keystrokes and mouse clicks.<br/>The butterflies are among more than 13 million specimens and other objects housed at the Peabody Museum, which is marking its 150th anniversary this year. For more than 125 years, the museum’s collections were cataloged in handwritten and typed ledgers, and searching the collections meant visiting the museum. <br/>Today, about two-thirds of the labels on the museum’s specimens are digitized. The Peabody has one of the best-developed and expansive digitization programs among natural history institutions in the United States, according to Integrated Digitized Biocollections (iDigBio), a collaborative effort funded by the National Science Foundation to coordinate digitization efforts among hundreds of natural history institutions in the United States.<br/>Among the more than 700 institutions that have provided records to iDigBio’s online data portal, the Peabody ranks in the top 10 with more than 1.2 million records contributed, according to Gil Nelson, iDigBio’s digitization specialist.<br/>“This ranking along with [Peabody] staff’s continued willingness and enthusiasm for offering input and coordination in community activities clearly demonstrates Yale’s leadership in North American biodiversity specimen digitization best practices and programs,” Nelson wrote in a Feb. 14, 2016 letter to Tim White, the Peabody’s director of collections and operations.<br/>The digital records can include a wide range of data — called metadata — such as where, when, and how a specimen was collected; the geographic coordinates of a collection site; a digital image when possible; links to archival information like field notes or published articles; and even genetic information.<br/>Making this information available online enables a vast range of scientific study, including research into pressing environmental and ecological issues such as global climate change and the decline of honeybee populations. Digitization also promotes teaching and learning using the collections. Multiple programs are being developed at the Peabody to provide elementary, middle and high school teachers lesson plans drawn straight from digitized collections.<br/>“It’s just spawned a revolution in how the metadata are used,” said Larry Gall, the Peabody’s head of computer systems and collections manager for its Division of Entomology, who has spearheaded the museum’s digitization efforts for 25 years.<br/><br/><b>Leather-bound ledgers to digital databases</b><br/>Eric Lazo-Wasem, senior collections manager in the Division of Invertebrate Zoology, points at an old Royal typewriter on a shelf above his desk.<br/>“When I started here in 1983, we typed all the specimen data on index cards,” he said, removing a stack of index cards from a cabinet in his office. “We’d do two sets of these for each specimen. I was essentially a typist back then.”<br/>The Peabody’s first personal computer, an IBM with two floppy disk drives, arrived in about 1985, Lazo-Wasem said.<br/>By 1991, the museum had established a computer systems office, and Gall began creating electronic catalog records for all the Peabody’s specimens and artifacts, dating to the museum’s founding in 1866.<br/>“We had these wonderful leather bound ledgers dating to the 1860s,” Gall said. “We covered them with Post-It notes and mapped the biological information in them, to figure out how to enter them most efficiently into the database.”<br/>The old records presented challenges. For example, the famed Yale College fossil hunting expeditions of the 1870s led by paleontologist Othniel Charles (O.C.) Marsh shipped train cars full of specimens from the American West to New Haven. The contents of the boxcars were divided among various departments at the museum, each with its own cataloging methods.<br/><i>“When I started here in 1983, we typed all the specimen data on index cards. … I was essentially a typist back then. … The digital world has made me a halfway decent photographer.”</i><br/>– Eric Lazo-Wasem, senior collections manager, Division of Invertebrate Zoology<br/>“We spent the first decade translating those ledgers and the central accession logs that documented everything that came into the museum,” Gall said. “Individual departments attacked their own ledgers, field notes, index cards, or whatever they had used.  My job was to steer the boat and make sure that people had comparable funding and that we were consistent in developing best practices with our databases.”<br/>After getting a handle on all the museum’s metadata the emphasis has begun to shift to creating digital images of as many specimens as possible.    <br/>“Digital cameras are now ubiquitous in every department,” said Gall. “All of them are doing at least some imaging. We’ve tricked out various workflows for that.”<br/>The Division of Invertebrate Paleontology has received federal grants to image tens of thousands of fossils — brachiopods, corals, trilobites, and more. Staff members wear a headset and read aloud label data from each specimen into voice recognition software that incorporates the information into a spreadsheet. Gall developed software that “cooks” the spreadsheet and imports it into the collection database, generating hundreds of images and records at once.<br/>Some collections lend themselves to digital imaging more readily than others, notes Gall. Plant specimens are pressed onto standard sized paper, which makes it easy to image them in large batches. The Peabody is part of a consortium of New England institutions that received grant funding to build a conveyor belt system to digitize collections of vascular plants. The conveyor system is being used at Harvard University and is scheduled to come to Yale’s West Campus next year.<br/>“Wet” specimens, often preserved in alcohol-filled glass jars and vials, are much more challenging to photograph.<br/>Lazo-Wasem said it’s often best to photograph specimens before they are submerged in alcohol. He said he stayed up into the early morning hours during collecting expeditions in Antarctica photographing fresh specimens.<br/>“The digital world has made me a halfway decent photographer,” he said.<br/>The Invertebrate Zoology Division has federal funding to image 60,000 microscope slides of specimen material from the collection. Once completed, researchers will have access to high-resolution images and the capability to zoom in on certain slides.<br/>“I’m seeing things here that I can’t see through a microscope,” he said, demonstrating the zoom function on one of the high-resolution images.<br/><b>Fostering research</b><br/>Michael Donoghue, Sterling Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, set two leaf specimens on a table. One had serrated edges. The other’s edges were smooth.<br/>“It turns out there’s a real pattern to this around the globe, and it relates to climate,” he said. “Leaves from cold climates — maples, birches, oaks — have teeth. Leaves from the tropics tend to have smooth edges.”<br/>Donoghue, the Peabody’s curator of botany, and his students are documenting the latitudinal pattern of the shapes of leaves and investigating why the shapes differ depending on climate. The work, which involves measuring leaf specimens from all over the globe, is greatly facilitated by digitizing specimens, he said.<br/>“If we had images of these specimens from all different latitudes and species, we could score them for the number of teeth they have and put all that information into a database that we’d have at our fingertips,” said Donoghue, who directed the Peabody from 2003 to 2008. “Right now we can’t do that.”<br/>Donoghue, who was instrumental in coordinating national efforts to digitize natural history collections, said the Peabody has been a leader in enabling research through digitization.<br/>“It’s going to foster a huge amount of research,” he said.<br/>Patrick Sweeney, senior collections manager for the Division of Botany, has prioritized getting images and data of all Yale Herbarium specimens online.<br/>“This enables all kinds of research,” Sweeney said. “It supports the Peabody’s and Yale’s mission in making the collections accessible globally any time and anywhere.”<br/>Much of the Peabody’s imaging work is funded through federal grants as part of the iDigBio initiative, often in arrangements called Thematic Collection Networks (TCNs), in which groups of institutions, often museums and universities, collaborate on developing strategy for digitizing collections to address a specific research theme, such as the effects of climate change.<br/>Sweeney is leading a TCN to digitize about 1.3 million vascular plant specimens at Yale and six other New England universities to create a dataset to help researchers study the effects of climate change. (The conveyor belt was built through this project.)<br/>The dataset, which is available online, includes information on phenology, or how and when plants bore fruit, produced their leaves, or flowered. Researchers are studying changes in phenology to gauge the effects of global warming on trees and other plants.  <br/>Digitization has also enabled research into the decline in populations of honeybees and other pollinators. From 2009 to 2012, the Peabody digitized the label data of about 20,000 bee specimens in the Entomology Division.  The metadata has been cited in several dozen peer-reviewed articles tying the decline of bee populations to factors like climate change or the use of neonicotinoids in insecticides, Gall said.<br/><b>Teaching with digital collections</b><br/>Digitization enhances the Peabody’s ability to fulfill its educational mission. A collaborative project to digitize images and data of 500,000 insect fossils at several institutions will equip teachers from kindergarten through high school with lesson plans using fossilized dragonflies, tsetse flies, and other insects.  The project, another TCN, will also enable the study of insect response to environmental change and patterns of insect biodiversity through time.<br/><i>“if you can put the collections onto a laptop, then you have the potential to teach [schoolchildren] to work with collections in their classrooms in the same way that we work with collections.”</i><br>– Christopher Norris, senior collection manger, Division of Vertebrate Paleontology<br/>“Fossil insects look a lot like modern insects, so kids can recognize them, whereas some of the other things you work on in paleontology aren’t quite so accessible,” said Susan Butts, senior collections manager for the Division of Invertebrate Paleontology.<br/>Digital specimens remove logistical hurdles to teaching students to work with museum collections, said Christopher Norris, senior collection manger for the Division of Vertebrate Paleontology.<br/>“Teaching kids how to use museum collections for research is also tricky if you have to bring them into the museum, bring them behind the scenes into the collections, and give them space to work,” Norris said. “If you can put the collections onto a laptop, then you have the potential to teach kids to work with collections in their classrooms in the same way that we work with collections.”<br/>The project’s digital portal, called iDigPaleo, will provide tools to allow students to map, measure, magnify, and annotate specimens. The portal will consolidate the digital information from the partnering institutions and will allow teachers to logon and access datasets of fossil records for their lessons plans. They can assess students’ work through the portal as well.<br/>“It offers all of the things you could do in a classroom activity, focused on real data accessed via the web,” Norris said<br/>The portal is scheduled to launch in the fall of 2016. Once established, it will be expanded to include other types of fossil collections.<br/><b>Looking ahead</b><br/>Digitizing the Peabody’s specimens is an endless task as the collections grow and researchers’ needs and focus change.<br/>Gall said the museum has done some three-dimensional imaging and CT-scanning, and he expects that those technologies will reach scale during this decade.<br/>The collections management database is continually augmented with new types of information. For example, the museum has begun digitizing its archival collections, including field notes, journals, and correspondence.<br/>“That’s the real hidden golden stuff,” said Gall. “We’re able to take the original field notebook, or even a page in it, and tie that to the specimen or an expedition and have digital proxies available.”<br/>The museum is using georeferencing mechanisms to assign latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates to where a specimen was collected. For instance, a label indicating that a plant specimen was collected “three miles from Hamden center” can be assigned coordinates along with a measure of their precision, Gall said.<br/>When specimens are sampled for DNA analysis, the genetic information can be added to a record’s digital metadata.<br/>“That’s full-bore information on a specimen’s history, it’s genetic history, everything,” Gall said.<br/>The Peabody’s undergraduate and graduate student workers are crucial to managing the endless digitization workload, according to Gall.<br/>“They’re smart, fast, and they know computers,” he said. “We get the work done at a high quality, and they love to work in the museum. We can empower all of these digital pipelines with the students. It’s a huge win-win all around.”<br/>Charlotte Newell, a senior who lives in Trumbull College, has worked with Gall digitizing specimens in the entomology collection since her freshman year. Newell, who is majoring in global affairs, has spent many quiet hours entering label data into the database.<br/>“I actually find it really relaxing to go work with all the cool and beautiful butterflies,” she said. “It’s interesting work but it doesn’t require intense problem-solving. It’s nice to work with all of this interesting material without stressing about it. And Larry is a great boss.”",
