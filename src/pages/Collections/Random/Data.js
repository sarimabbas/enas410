The bird models for the Connecticut Bird Hall are getting close to being completed and I will shift my focus to the North American Mammal diorama hall. Collin and I looked closely at each diorama to note where we might improve them. The mammal taxidermy in many of these dioramas need repair and recoloring, but there will be some need for creation of new leaves, installing new snow, and coloring groundcover and epiphytes.<br/>Additionally, in the Desert diorama, there are dried specimens of scorpions and centipedes that periodically disappear as a result of living populations of carpet beetles inside the dioramas. Therefore, I would like to create 3D models of some of these invertebrate specimens. The sizes of the specimens pose a problem. We are looking into whether our scans are good enough or whether our printers are precise enough to pick up minute detail like legs and antennae. Also, the scanner doesn’t like dark, shiny surfaces (mostly what we have to scan) and the scans tend to go haywire.<br/>To see if it is possible to scan and print small bodies with small appendages, we have to experiment with testing removable surface materials.<br/>We had to get specimens of less importance on which to practice. My colleague, Maishe Dickman is an avid insect collector with a special interest in giant Titan Beetles from the neotropics. The smaller specimens are not as important to Maishe, so he agreed to bring in several of the smaller ones for us to work on. He had them in the freezer, so they had to be thawed, pinned and dried.<br/>Just the drying alone takes several days. In the meantime, Nicole Palffy-Muhoray, representing the Entomology Department, told me that we could use specimens from the Entomology study collection so long as we can wash off the surfacing materials we apply. I asked her how to wash a beetle and she brought over an ultrasonic jewelry cleaner! I was floored that this is how specimens are cleaned in the Entomology collection.<br/>We picked out several beetles, scorpions, and centipedes from the study collection and began to experiment. I wondered how dusting might work. Collin sanded several sticks of chalk to dust and I have whiting that I use in mache, which also turns out to be chalk dust! I have confectioners sugar, which I have used in the past on my silicone castings and Kremer dry white pigment. I went online because I figure others have run into this problem and must have found a solution. The solution I found is to adjust the settings of the scanner and to use an opaque, matte “developer” aerosol called Spotcheck. Spotcheck is very expensive, so we will continue our experiments…<br/>It took about five minutes to realize that dusting won’t work because the surfaces of the bugs are too smooth for the dust to grab on to. Gum Arabic, a water-soluble tree sap, was suggested at an art supply house as a reversible medium in which to add the dusting powders to create a paintable surface. This basically creates watercolor pigment and can be built up over several layers to coat the insects. Nicole went to Michael’s craft store and picked up some reversible children’s poster paints and a spray can of chalk dust as additional materials to experiment with.<br/>We will try scanning these three test subjects to see if the scans work and if the surfacing material can be easily removed. More to come soon.",

Today, he is painting the final touches on the last one, the White-rumped Sandpiper. When painting is completed, we will have our ornithology collections manager, Kristof Zyskowski, critique them, after which we will install them in the Connecticut Bird Hall alongside the previously approved, Baird’s Sandpiper. With four models produced from one digital scan of a taxidermied Baird’s Sandpiper, we had to print the models at varying percentages from the original. With each model that was reduced from the original, I made sure the wing and leg lengths were accurate for the specific bird. Each unique bill was cast in epoxy and attached to the models. All defining field marks were painted and the local color of the feathers was ascertained by matching it to a study skin from the collections. (see the previous blog post, “The First Digital Bird Lands”)<br/><br/>New Horizons:<br/>With the Blended Realities project well on its way, we are looking to other ways to use the SPROUT workstation. Recently, I sculpted a “gestural” model of a Merlin falcon in clay. I didn’t have a taxidermied mount to scan, so I am sculpting a clay model in the position I want for the Bird Hall. I have started with clay sculptures before and typically, I would make a 2 part plaster mold of the clay sculpture and cast a copy in wax. This would usually take eight to ten hours of my time.<br/>In this case, Collin scanned the clay sculpture and it is now being printed out in plastic.<br/>Once the feather detail is carved into the wax, we will paint directly on the wax.  The 3D plastic sculpture covered with a thin layer of wax, painted to look realistic, is robust enough to install directly without having to make another rubber mold and cast. This is another big time and money saver<br/>Another experiment came about when I discovered that the Long-tailed Weasel in the Forest Margin diorama had received a serious case of insect damage. We removed it from the diorama and decided to try scanning and printing it as is. You can easily patch the areas decimated by bugs with wax and there were other areas where the model had to be sanded using the original taxidermy mount as a guide. I know how to sculpt bird feathers, but I don’t have a lot of experience sculpting mammal fur. I’m going to get a lesson with Dorcas MacClintock and see if I can get something good enough to install in the diorama.",

Most were found in farmers’ fields or in early excavations when archaeological methods were imprecise and less sophisticated than today. <br/>The exhibition asks, “Can artistic interpretation and scientific investigation co-exist?” The answer is a resounding “yes” as the goal of archaeologist and artist alike is to “ponder the imponderable, to get into the mind of the long-dead creator,” says Roderick McIntosh, professor of anthropology at Yale.<br/>“Being excited to wonder about the ineffable — daring to imagine that one human being might delve inside the mind of another human being who lived 100 generations ago — might just be the key to being human,” adds McIntosh, who is also curator-in-charge of anthropology at the Yale Peabody Museum.<br/>Kavanagh, a New Haven-born artist, has been in awe of these figures since seeing the so-called “Venus of Lespugue” in Paris as a child. She began contemplating “how people living at the edges of glacial ice could produce such expressive sculpture with stone tools,” she says. She was also intrigued by how the figures evoke the sculpture of Modernists like Hans Arp, Joan Miró, and Henry Moore, who have long informed her work.<br/>For the exhibition Kavanagh faithfully replicated 12 of the ancient figures, choosing polymer and bronze as her medium in lieu of the soft stone, bone, and ivory from which many of the originals were carved, or the clay from which some were formed and fired. Whereas the original figures ranged from 1.4 to 8.9 inches high, Kavanagh enlarged the scale of hers to make the surface details more visible.<br/>She then placed them in seashells selected to complement each figure. Shells have not only informed Kavanagh’s own work but have long been associated with birth and regeneration. Each of the figures shown in its shell is a complete sculpture and can be compared with its original artifact.<br/><br/>The 12 artifacts providing inspiration for Kavanagh’s sculptures include:<br/>1. Hohle Fels. Excavated in 2008 from the Hohle Fels Caves of Schelkingen, Germany, and claimed by some to date as early as 40,000 BCE, this piece can only be roughly attributed to sometime before the early Solutrean (before c.24,000).<br/>2. Brassempouy. This head in mammoth ivory is purportedly from the Grotte du Pape in southwestern France. It is considered one of the finest pieces of the earliest Aurignacial (after 30,000 BCE). Her tiny triangular face bears an intense stare and pronounced brow but no mouth.<br/>3. Lespugue. This Gravettian (c. 25,000 BCE) piece from the Les Rideaux Cave in the Pyrenees is the figure that inspired Kavanagh as a child. Possessing the most pronounced features of all Upper Paleolithic figures, her enormous breasts, buttocks, belly and thighs are fashioned into a nest of eggs. Picasso purportedly kept two castings of her in his studio, considering her the “quintessential female form.<br/>4. Willendorf. Because of her enormous breasts, enlarged abdomen and ample buttocks, she is one of the most recognizable of Upper Paleolithic pieces. Willendorf lacks a secure date but the piece may possibly be late Gravettian (post-25,000 BCE).<br/>Kavanagh is a daughter of George Kubler, who is considered one of the most influential art historians of the 20th century. Nurtured in an environment rich in the visual arts, her artistic consciousness was further developed by extensive travels and study in South America and Europe. She taught herself to carve stone in the Modernist tradition of Moore, Barbara Hepworth and Arp, eventually developing a signature style of her own characterized by rounded, sensual shapes. As demand for her sculpture increased, Kavanagh began carving maquettes out of polystyrene, finishing them with plaster for casting in bronze and aluminum. She has exhibited at the American Museum of Natural History, the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History, and the Peabody-Essex Museum.<br/>“The Artist’s Eye: Figurines of the Paleolithic” is open during regular museum hours: Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sundays from noon to 5 p.m.",

New research by Emanuel Tschopp of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa in Portugal recently concluded that Brontosaurus was, in fact, a distinct species from Apatosaurus based on unique physical characteristics.<br/>Scientists had stripped Brontosaurus of its separate status in the early 1900s, saying that Brontosaurus fossils were, in fact, specimens of the previously named Apatosaurus. This was of particular importance at Yale, where pioneering paleontologist O.C. Marsh had given the Brontosaurus its name in 1879, and where the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History had the most complete Brontosaurus skeleton — discovered in Wyoming — on display in the Great Hall of Dinosaurs.<br/>On April 14, the museum will officially re-label its specimen Brontosaurus.<br/>YaleNews spoke with Jacques Gauthier, professor of geology and geophysics and curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Peabody, to talk about all things Brontosaurus.<br/><b>Were you surprised by the reclassification?</b><br/>I knew this was coming. More than one set of researchers was beginning to look into it, and then Emanuel locked in. His approach was to say: I’m going to look at each specimen independently, take down the data from each one of them, run it through phylogenetic software packages, and create a family tree that will tell me, ‘this specimen goes here and that specimen goes there.’ That way, you discover the species, rather than frontload them into your analysis.<br/><b>Do you agree with this approach?</b><br/>Yes, I believe it’s the most modern method for doing the sort of analysis we’re talking about here. You’re not deciding on the boundaries of each species in advance. I’ve had students who have used this method with turtles, for example. This is a modern approach to paleontology.<br/><b>Did the researchers looking at Brontosaurus visit Yale?</b><br/>Yes, they were here last year to look at and measure our specimens. We were delighted.<br/><b>So you’re happy about the name change.</b><br/>I am, and I don’t know why, exactly. But I really am. I like the idea that we’re finding out more about the structure of nature because of this. I also thought it was good that this result came from someone who doesn’t have a dog in the fight, like I do. I’ve always liked the name Brontosaurus, which means “thunder lizard.”<br/><b>What does the name change mean for the museum, in practical terms?</b><br/>We have a lot of labels in the museum that make mention of Apatosaurus. Now we need to go change them, which is a painful thing. Also, we’re racing around now to see if we can find an Apatosaurus neck rib that we can show, to compare it with the neck ribs of Brontosaurus. It’s easy to see the difference between them. Tschopp’s study discovered at least seven different anatomical characteristics separating Brontosaurus from Apatosaurus.<br/><b>What does this new information say about Brontosaurus beyond particular physical differences from Apatosaurus?</b><br/>It says that Brontosaurus was not merely a variation. It says Brontosaurus was on its own, independent evolutionary path. It also means there were more kinds of giant sauropods lumbering about than we once thought.<br/><b>Does it also create educational and research opportunities for Yale?</b><br/>I hope it will be a springboard for renewed interest, both here on campus and in the international scientific community, for what we have in the Great Hall.

Each drawer contains rows of butterfly specimens of various sizes and colors carefully pinned under glass.<br/>A student worker will pick up that first drawer, move the Post-It to the next one, and remove the butterflies. The data on the labels attached to the pins, along with digital images of certain specimens, will be entered into the Peabody’s collections management database, where researchers worldwide can access them with a few keystrokes and mouse clicks.<br/>The butterflies are among more than 13 million specimens and other objects housed at the Peabody Museum, which is marking its 150th anniversary this year. For more than 125 years, the museum’s collections were cataloged in handwritten and typed ledgers, and searching the collections meant visiting the museum. <br/>Today, about two-thirds of the labels on the museum’s specimens are digitized. The Peabody has one of the best-developed and expansive digitization programs among natural history institutions in the United States, according to Integrated Digitized Biocollections (iDigBio), a collaborative effort funded by the National Science Foundation to coordinate digitization efforts among hundreds of natural history institutions in the United States.<br/>Among the more than 700 institutions that have provided records to iDigBio’s online data portal, the Peabody ranks in the top 10 with more than 1.2 million records contributed, according to Gil Nelson, iDigBio’s digitization specialist.<br/>“This ranking along with [Peabody] staff’s continued willingness and enthusiasm for offering input and coordination in community activities clearly demonstrates Yale’s leadership in North American biodiversity specimen digitization best practices and programs,” Nelson wrote in a Feb. 14, 2016 letter to Tim White, the Peabody’s director of collections and operations.<br/>The digital records can include a wide range of data — called metadata — such as where, when, and how a specimen was collected; the geographic coordinates of a collection site; a digital image when possible; links to archival information like field notes or published articles; and even genetic information.<br/>Making this information available online enables a vast range of scientific study, including research into pressing environmental and ecological issues such as global climate change and the decline of honeybee populations. Digitization also promotes teaching and learning using the collections. Multiple programs are being developed at the Peabody to provide elementary, middle and high school teachers lesson plans drawn straight from digitized collections.<br/>“It’s just spawned a revolution in how the metadata are used,” said Larry Gall, the Peabody’s head of computer systems and collections manager for its Division of Entomology, who has spearheaded the museum’s digitization efforts for 25 years.<br/><br/><b>Leather-bound ledgers to digital databases</b><br/>Eric Lazo-Wasem, senior collections manager in the Division of Invertebrate Zoology, points at an old Royal typewriter on a shelf above his desk.<br/>“When I started here in 1983, we typed all the specimen data on index cards,” he said, removing a stack of index cards from a cabinet in his office. “We’d do two sets of these for each specimen. I was essentially a typist back then.”<br/>The Peabody’s first personal computer, an IBM with two floppy disk drives, arrived in about 1985, Lazo-Wasem said.<br/>By 1991, the museum had established a computer systems office, and Gall began creating electronic catalog records for all the Peabody’s specimens and artifacts, dating to the museum’s founding in 1866.<br/>“We had these wonderful leather bound ledgers dating to the 1860s,” Gall said. “We covered them with Post-It notes and mapped the biological information in them, to figure out how to enter them most efficiently into the database.”<br/>The old records presented challenges. For example, the famed Yale College fossil hunting expeditions of the 1870s led by paleontologist Othniel Charles (O.C.) Marsh shipped train cars full of specimens from the American West to New Haven. The contents of the boxcars were divided among various departments at the museum, each with its own cataloging methods.<br/><i>“When I started here in 1983, we typed all the specimen data on index cards. … I was essentially a typist back then. … The digital world has made me a halfway decent photographer.”</i><br/>– Eric Lazo-Wasem, senior collections manager, Division of Invertebrate Zoology<br/>“We spent the first decade translating those ledgers and the central accession logs that documented everything that came into the museum,” Gall said. “Individual departments attacked their own ledgers, field notes, index cards, or whatever they had used.  My job was to steer the boat and make sure that people had comparable funding and that we were consistent in developing best practices with our databases.”<br/>After getting a handle on all the museum’s metadata the emphasis has begun to shift to creating digital images of as many specimens as possible.    <br/>“Digital cameras are now ubiquitous in every department,” said Gall. “All of them are doing at least some imaging. We’ve tricked out various workflows for that.”<br/>The Division of Invertebrate Paleontology has received federal grants to image tens of thousands of fossils — brachiopods, corals, trilobites, and more. Staff members wear a headset and read aloud label data from each specimen into voice recognition software that incorporates the information into a spreadsheet. Gall developed software that “cooks” the spreadsheet and imports it into the collection database, generating hundreds of images and records at once.<br/>Some collections lend themselves to digital imaging more readily than others, notes Gall. Plant specimens are pressed onto standard sized paper, which makes it easy to image them in large batches. The Peabody is part of a consortium of New England institutions that received grant funding to build a conveyor belt system to digitize collections of vascular plants. The conveyor system is being used at Harvard University and is scheduled to come to Yale’s West Campus next year.<br/>“Wet” specimens, often preserved in alcohol-filled glass jars and vials, are much more challenging to photograph.<br/>Lazo-Wasem said it’s often best to photograph specimens before they are submerged in alcohol. He said he stayed up into the early morning hours during collecting expeditions in Antarctica photographing fresh specimens.<br/>“The digital world has made me a halfway decent photographer,” he said.<br/>The Invertebrate Zoology Division has federal funding to image 60,000 microscope slides of specimen material from the collection. Once completed, researchers will have access to high-resolution images and the capability to zoom in on certain slides.<br/>“I’m seeing things here that I can’t see through a microscope,” he said, demonstrating the zoom function on one of the high-resolution images.<br/><b>Fostering research</b><br/>Michael Donoghue, Sterling Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, set two leaf specimens on a table. One had serrated edges. The other’s edges were smooth.<br/>“It turns out there’s a real pattern to this around the globe, and it relates to climate,” he said. “Leaves from cold climates — maples, birches, oaks — have teeth. Leaves from the tropics tend to have smooth edges.”<br/>Donoghue, the Peabody’s curator of botany, and his students are documenting the latitudinal pattern of the shapes of leaves and investigating why the shapes differ depending on climate. The work, which involves measuring leaf specimens from all over the globe, is greatly facilitated by digitizing specimens, he said.<br/>“If we had images of these specimens from all different latitudes and species, we could score them for the number of teeth they have and put all that information into a database that we’d have at our fingertips,” said Donoghue, who directed the Peabody from 2003 to 2008. “Right now we can’t do that.”<br/>Donoghue, who was instrumental in coordinating national efforts to digitize natural history collections, said the Peabody has been a leader in enabling research through digitization.<br/>“It’s going to foster a huge amount of research,” he said.<br/>Patrick Sweeney, senior collections manager for the Division of Botany, has prioritized getting images and data of all Yale Herbarium specimens online.<br/>“This enables all kinds of research,” Sweeney said. “It supports the Peabody’s and Yale’s mission in making the collections accessible globally any time and anywhere.”<br/>Much of the Peabody’s imaging work is funded through federal grants as part of the iDigBio initiative, often in arrangements called Thematic Collection Networks (TCNs), in which groups of institutions, often museums and universities, collaborate on developing strategy for digitizing collections to address a specific research theme, such as the effects of climate change.<br/>Sweeney is leading a TCN to digitize about 1.3 million vascular plant specimens at Yale and six other New England universities to create a dataset to help researchers study the effects of climate change. (The conveyor belt was built through this project.)<br/>The dataset, which is available online, includes information on phenology, or how and when plants bore fruit, produced their leaves, or flowered. Researchers are studying changes in phenology to gauge the effects of global warming on trees and other plants.  <br/>Digitization has also enabled research into the decline in populations of honeybees and other pollinators. From 2009 to 2012, the Peabody digitized the label data of about 20,000 bee specimens in the Entomology Division.  The metadata has been cited in several dozen peer-reviewed articles tying the decline of bee populations to factors like climate change or the use of neonicotinoids in insecticides, Gall said.<br/><b>Teaching with digital collections</b><br/>Digitization enhances the Peabody’s ability to fulfill its educational mission. A collaborative project to digitize images and data of 500,000 insect fossils at several institutions will equip teachers from kindergarten through high school with lesson plans using fossilized dragonflies, tsetse flies, and other insects.  The project, another TCN, will also enable the study of insect response to environmental change and patterns of insect biodiversity through time.<br/><i>“if you can put the collections onto a laptop, then you have the potential to teach [schoolchildren] to work with collections in their classrooms in the same way that we work with collections.”</i><br>– Christopher Norris, senior collection manger, Division of Vertebrate Paleontology<br/>“Fossil insects look a lot like modern insects, so kids can recognize them, whereas some of the other things you work on in paleontology aren’t quite so accessible,” said Susan Butts, senior collections manager for the Division of Invertebrate Paleontology.<br/>Digital specimens remove logistical hurdles to teaching students to work with museum collections, said Christopher Norris, senior collection manger for the Division of Vertebrate Paleontology.<br/>“Teaching kids how to use museum collections for research is also tricky if you have to bring them into the museum, bring them behind the scenes into the collections, and give them space to work,” Norris said. “If you can put the collections onto a laptop, then you have the potential to teach kids to work with collections in their classrooms in the same way that we work with collections.”<br/>The project’s digital portal, called iDigPaleo, will provide tools to allow students to map, measure, magnify, and annotate specimens. The portal will consolidate the digital information from the partnering institutions and will allow teachers to logon and access datasets of fossil records for their lessons plans. They can assess students’ work through the portal as well.<br/>“It offers all of the things you could do in a classroom activity, focused on real data accessed via the web,” Norris said<br/>The portal is scheduled to launch in the fall of 2016. Once established, it will be expanded to include other types of fossil collections.<br/><b>Looking ahead</b><br/>Digitizing the Peabody’s specimens is an endless task as the collections grow and researchers’ needs and focus change.<br/>Gall said the museum has done some three-dimensional imaging and CT-scanning, and he expects that those technologies will reach scale during this decade.<br/>The collections management database is continually augmented with new types of information. For example, the museum has begun digitizing its archival collections, including field notes, journals, and correspondence.<br/>“That’s the real hidden golden stuff,” said Gall. “We’re able to take the original field notebook, or even a page in it, and tie that to the specimen or an expedition and have digital proxies available.”<br/>The museum is using georeferencing mechanisms to assign latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates to where a specimen was collected. For instance, a label indicating that a plant specimen was collected “three miles from Hamden center” can be assigned coordinates along with a measure of their precision, Gall said.<br/>When specimens are sampled for DNA analysis, the genetic information can be added to a record’s digital metadata.<br/>“That’s full-bore information on a specimen’s history, it’s genetic history, everything,” Gall said.<br/>The Peabody’s undergraduate and graduate student workers are crucial to managing the endless digitization workload, according to Gall.<br/>“They’re smart, fast, and they know computers,” he said. “We get the work done at a high quality, and they love to work in the museum. We can empower all of these digital pipelines with the students. It’s a huge win-win all around.”<br/>Charlotte Newell, a senior who lives in Trumbull College, has worked with Gall digitizing specimens in the entomology collection since her freshman year. Newell, who is majoring in global affairs, has spent many quiet hours entering label data into the database.<br/>“I actually find it really relaxing to go work with all the cool and beautiful butterflies,” she said. “It’s interesting work but it doesn’t require intense problem-solving. It’s nice to work with all of this interesting material without stressing about it. And Larry is a great boss.”",
