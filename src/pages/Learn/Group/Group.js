                    <b>Ancient Egypt</b>
                    <br/><i>Grade 4 through High School</i> 
                    <br/>Yale University’s extensive collections provide a framework for understanding the lives of Egyptians who lived 3,000 years ago. The artifacts on exhibit in Daily Life in Ancient Egypt include canopic jars, everyday utensils such as a mirror and make-up jars, animal mummies and ceremonial items. Of the two human mummies on display; one is 5,000 years old and was naturally mummified. An X-ray study of the other, a wrapped mummy, surprised researchers with evidence that he had been murdered. This fascinating topic provides an enthralling program for students.

                    <b>The Art of the Diorama</b>
                    <br/><i>Grade 4 through High School</i>
                    <br/>This program discusses the creation of the Yale Peabody Museum’s dioramas, exceptional for their artistry as well as their science content. Students will learn about the painting, sculpture, taxidermy and mold-making techniques that were used to create these masterpieces of illusion. The dioramas were largely the work of James Perry Wilson, who honed his skills as a background painter for the American Museum of Natural History, and Ralph Morrill, who created the extraordinarily lively and life-like foregrounds of the dioramas. The class includes hands-on-specimens and a short film about the creation of the Timber Line diorama.

                    <b>Drawing on Nature</b>
                    <br/><i>Grade 4 through High School</i>
                    <br/>This is an opportunity for art teachers to have their students draw from museum specimens in a private classroom. We will make available bones, butterflies, shells and many other natural history specimens (the Museum does not provide art supplies). There is no instructor, unless requested, but Museum staff will be present to help with specimens and questions.

                    <b>Paleo Art at the Peabody</b>
                    <br/><i>Middle and High School</i>
                    <br/>We often accept restorations of prehistoric animals as "real." This class discusses the art and science of recreating "real" dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals by examining two of the Yale Peabody Museum’s greatest icons, the Pulitzer award-winning The Age of Reptiles mural, completed in 1947 by Rudolph Zallinger, and the 22-foot-long bronze Torosaurus sculpture by Museum Preparator Michael Anderson dedicated in 2004. Though the study of dinosaurs has revealed many new insights about these amazing creatures participants will discover that the process involved in recreating dinosaurs has changed very little. This program will include specimens and materials that were used in the creation of the mural and Torosaurus sculpture.

                    <b>Animal Adaptations</b>
                    <br/><i>Elementary and Middle School</i>
                    <br/>All living things are the result of successful adaptation.  Some of these adaptations are physical and some are behavioral. Together, these adaptations make each living thing unique.  This program will introduce the concepts of evolution, natural selection and species with examples from the Museum's dioramas, specimens, casts and pelts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Birds and Their Adaptations</b>
                    <br/><i>Elementary and Middle School</i>
                    <br/>The Yale Peabody Museum’s wonderful Birds of Connecticut Hall provides a focus for learning about wild animals that are part of our everyday lives. Every child sees birds, yet most know very little about these fascinating creatures. Seeing such common birds as the ring-billed gull (Larus delawarensis), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) and crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos) can help students be more aware of wild animals that are part of their world. The instructor will also discuss concepts basic to the science of biology, including animal adaptations, migration and endangered species, appropriate to the ability of the students and their interests.

                    <b>Biodiversity</b>
                    <br/><i>Elementary School</i>
                    <br/>The Museum’s North American Dioramas reveal the diversity of life on our continent.  Using these “windows into the natural world” to illustrate the concept of biodiversity, this program will compare and contrast the variety of plant and animal life associated with these representatives of North America's biomes.  The contributions of biotic and abiotic factors to species diversity will be explored using activities and hands-on objects.

                    <b>Connecticut Habitats and Wildlife</b>
                    <br/><i>Elementary and Middle School</i>
                    <br/>The Connecticut dioramas were developed with the help of one of the founders of the science of ecology, G. Evelyn Hutchinson. These Yale Peabody Museum's dioramas allow the students to visualize complex food webs and ecology in four distinct habitat types present in Connecticut.  This program focuses on habitat, with an investigation of biotic and abiotic factors, biodiversity, and human impacts.

                    <b>Extinct and Endangered Species</b>
                    <br/><i>Grade 4 through High School</i>
                    <br/>Although most people have been introduced to the issue of extinction as a modern problem, it is a naturally occurring process going back to the beginning of life on Earth. Extinction can have many causes, but primary amount them are habitat loss and climate change.  While highlighting examples of extinction in the distant past, this program also presents the rate of modern extinctions and how human activities may be a contributing factor.  Using exhibits and specimens relating to extinct and endangered plants and animals both locally and throughout North America, the program will explore how individuals can make a difference.

                    <b>Introduction to Evolution</b>
                    <br/><i>Middle and High School</i>
                    <br/>Outstanding exhibits of prehistoric animal and plant fossils are used to illustrate current theories on the mechanisms of biological change that are evolution.  These specimens provide evidence for the process of evolution through natural selection and genetic mutation.  Evolution has been a primary research subject at the Peabody Museum for more than 100 years and many of the Museum's exhibits were produced to promote the understanding of evolution.  Specimens will highlight current research on the close relationship between birds and dinosaurs, horse evolution, mass extinctions and a brief look at human origins.

                    <b>Light, Color and Nature</b>
                    <br/><i>Elementary and Middle School</i>
                    <br/>What is light? How are rainbows formed? Do polar bears really have white fur? This program is an introduction to light and color with an emphasis on human vision, how we perceive light, and how color is used in nature. Using hands-on models and demonstrations this class begins with Newton’s famous prism experiment of the 1600’s and continues with an exploration of human eye anatomy. Students will also explore how animals use color to adapt to various environments through camouflage, mimicry or announcing colors.

                    <b>North American Wildlife and Ecology</b>
                    <br/><i>Grade 3 through High School</i>
                    <br/>The Yale Peabody Museum's eight North American dioramas represent habitat regions throughout North America, including the tundra, high mesa, rainforest, grasslands, desert and marsh. Each diorama highlights the variety of animal and plant life in these specific natural regions. Teachers are invited to choose areas that fit their curriculum. Viewing the representations of each provides the basis for a thoughtful discussion about the biodiversity, history, differences and similarities of each of these areas. Students will have the opportunity to touch an Arctic musk ox specimen and consider its various evolutionary adaptations, as well as adaptations of other animals and plants represented in the dioramas.
